BootLoader=If a microcontroller unit (MCU) like the sensor device is first powered on, it usually does not have an operating system in ROM or RAM. In this case the device needs to execute a relatively small program stored in ROM, along with the bare minimum of data needed to access the non-volatile memory devices from which the operating system and data may be loaded into RAM.

SCTL=Sensor Control, In the AUTOSAR architecture the SCTL substitutes partly the ECU State Manager / BSW Manager. The decision was to use and adapt the existing SCTL from ARS4xx projects to the needs of the new architecture. The primary task of the SCTL is to store and manage the operation mode of the radar sensor functionality. All algorithm software components and RfCom, diagnostics and CAN component are conform to their type of operation to the central operation mode in SCTL. A change in the type of operation of any component that is so important that it affects the type of operation of other algorithm components can occur only as a result of a change in the operation mode in SCTL. This ensures that all the operations performed by all algorithm software components on the ECU behave as a coherent whole.  All changes in the operation mode are performed by the SCTL itself. For this purpose, the SCTL may contain a state machine in which the state variable is the operation mode. In this document, the terms “state”, “mode”, and “operation mode value” are generally used as synonyms. The SCTL executes state transitions in response to: (1) events sent to the SCTL component; (2) information that the SCTL component actively fetches from other software components (e.g FID).

VDY = Vehicle dynamics
vdy=vehicle dynamics
CAT3=Errors which will not put the sensor to reset even when the faults are present
CAT3=A Category 3 (Cat3) failure means, that the MCU detects by SW a kind of HW failure, which does not consider, that the MCU or vehicle communication interface HW is not reliable. The device keeps running to allow communication with the vehicle to report the failure immediatly (within next communication cycle).
CAT1=A Category 1 (Cat1) failure means that the MCU runs out of control or does not start at all. This may be caused by a HW defect as well as a HW monitoring & protection circuit (e.g. power supply & reset control).There is no SW intervention (and therefore no DTC) and no vehicle communication.
CAT1=                           Error detected by hardware without software contribution
CAT2=A Category 2 (Cat2) failure means, that the MCU itself detects a failure, which considers that the MCU or the vehicle communication interface HW is not reliable. In difference to Cat1 there is some SW intervention to initiate a HW shutdown.                        Error detected by software, system not reliable to run and / or communicate with the vehicle.
CAT4=A Category 4 (Cat4) failure means, that the MCU detects a failure, which is not caused by the device itself (neither HW nor SW) and which is recoverable by a restart.
CAT5=A Category 5 (Cat5) failure means, that the MCU detects a failure, which is not caused by the device itself (neither HW nor SW) and which is recoverable by an external trigger event (e.g. communication signal , discrete input signal or re-flashing).
CAT6=A Category 6 (Cat6) failure means, that the MCU detects a failure, which is not caused by the device itself (neither HW nor SW) and which shall be recoverable automatically (without need of any further interaction) as soon as the failure condition disappeared ( = back-filtered ).
CAT7=A Category 7 (Cat7) failure means, that the MCU detects a failure which is not caused by the device itself (neither HW nor SW) and which shall not cause a DTC, but rise a notification signal and disable a cartain fuction via FIM.
DEM=The Diagnostic Event Management (DEM) is a sub-component of the diagnostic module within or according to the AUTOSAR standard. It is responsible for processing and storing diagnostic events (errors) and associated FreezeFrame data. Further, the DEM provides fault information to the Diagnostic Communication Manager (DCM) which stores the related, customer-specific Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) in the event memory.
CAT3=                              Microcontroller detects a HW failure condition, but the MCU and vehicle communication interface are considered to be reliable.
EOL=The feature End of Line Alignment provides a fast and precise method to ensure that every vehicle which leaves the assembly line, has a completely aligned (sensor) device.
AIA=The feature Automatic Industrial Alignment (="Werksfreie Justage") is similar to the Service Alignment. However, in contrast to the Service Alignment, there will be continuous adjustment and the device functions will gradually become available as the alignment improves (e.g. comfort functions like ACC will become available if misalignment will drop  below 0.7°).
serviceALN=The feature Service Alignment provides means for re-alignment of the device after vehicle repair and for first alignment after sensor replacement. In contrast to EOL alignment no special equipment is required, but as a consequence it takes some time until the re-calibration will be completed. The alignment function will be performed during a test drive while no device function will be available before completion.                    In order to start Service Alignment a diagnostic command needs to be sent to the device. Then the technician has to drive the vehicle for a few minutes. After the calibration drive the sensor is either aligned or it notifies with an error message that it is not able to compensate the misalignment.                              Elevation alignment is not supported by all product variants.                  Upon reception of the SysIF_Ignition_Start signal at the vehicle communication interface the Service Alignment function (Service ALN) of the device shall be started if the following conditions are met:   SysNV_Sensor_Aligned_Once == FALSE and   SysOpt_ALN_Function_ActiveOnDelivery == SERVICE_ALN and   SysOpt_ALN_MethodLastCycle = NONE (i.e. there was no alignment function active in the previous ignition cycle)    or    SysOpt_ALN_MethodLastCycle = Service_ALN (i.e. Service ALN was active at the end of the previous ignition cycle and therefore shall be restarted)
EOL=For end of line alignment specific equipment is required, such as a metal reflector plate with dedicated dimensions which needs to be mounted in front of the vehicle within specific distance and angle tolerances.                                     The EOL alignment of the device shall not require any manual adjustment or calibration of the mounting of the device at the vehicle                       A metal plate reflector is required for EOL alignment which needs to be precisely adjusted perpendicularly to the vehicle driving vector. Proper alignment of the metal plate shall be ensured in both, horizontal and vertical direction.                          Any misalignment between the vehicle driving vector and the metal plate will lead to a failure of the EOL alignment procedure  (i.e. a deadjusted device).                   The EOL ALN procedure shall also work with a corner reflector (instead of a metal plate).
ALN=Auto Alignment   ----------------- The feature cluster Auto Alignment refers to the capability of the device to align itself automatically without the need for mechanical adjustment of the mounting of the device in the vehicle (e.g. with screws)    There is no need to access the device physically, i.e. it can be/remain mounted behind the bumper in the car during EOL alignment.

All faults detected by hardware measures are reported to the FCCU. The FCCU monitors critical control signals and collects all errors. Depending on the type of fault, the FCCU places the device into an appropriately configured Safe stateMCU. To achieve this, application software shall configure the FCCU appropriately
FOSU=The FCCU is checked by FOSU which provides a secondary path for failure indication and reports to the MC_RGM.
